GOAL: Simple scrolling shooter project to tinker with as part of getting back into GODOT engine.
Justification: 1-None of my other Godot Projects have any code on GitHub. 2-I've been wanting to get back into digital development but haven't had time with web priority.
Priority: Low.
Timeline: Completion sometime before end of next year. Should be plenty of time, but if I fail it's a sign.
